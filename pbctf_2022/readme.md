Move VM

## 1. Disassemble file message.mv

`message.mv` is a `move bytecode` file which is used in blockchain

i found at move has a [disassember](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/main/language/tools/move-disassembler), you can compile move module based on [this](https://github.com/movelanguage/move/blob/main/language/documentation/tutorial/README.md#Step0) and disassemble file .mv

Also, i found some docs about file format, bytecode at [this](https://github.com/move-language/move/issues/817), you can write you own disassembler based on them. 

After built tool, i disassembled file and have its [bytecode]()
